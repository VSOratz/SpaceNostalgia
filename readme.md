#### Description:
This is a small project created in Lua using the Love2D framework. The aim of this project is to recreate the experience of a classic space shooter game, inspired by the games that marked my childhood.

## Project Files:

- `main.lua`: This file contains the main game logic, including player controls, enemy spawning, collision detection, and scoring mechanism.
- `components/player.lua`: Manages the player's spaceship, handling movement and shooting functionality.
- `components/enemy.lua`: Controls the behavior of enemy spacecraft, including movement patterns.
- `img/` and `sound/`: Directory containing all game assets, including images and sound effects.
- `conf.lua`: This file contains the settings window

## Design Choices:

- Retro Aesthetic: I opted for retro-style graphics and sound effects to evoke a sense of nostalgia and pay homage to classic arcade games.
- Simple Controls: The game uses straightforward controls, allowing players to use either the WASD keys or arrow keys for movement and the space bar for shooting. This choice ensures accessibility and ease of play.
- Modular Code: I organized the game logic into separate files for better maintainability and readability. Each component (player, enemy, main game logic) is encapsulated in its own module, making it easier to manage and debug.

# Features
Control of a spaceship using the keys ASDW or arrow keys (up, left, down, right) for movement.
Press the space bar to shoot.
Enemies that move randomly.
Scoring system to track the player's performance.
Retro graphics and sounds for a nostalgic experience.

# How to Play
Make sure you have Love2D installed on your system. For more information on how to install Love2D, please refer to the official Love2D website. (https://love2d.org/)

# Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/VSOratz/SpaceNostalgia.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd SpaceNostalgia

# Start the game:
love .
When prompted, enter your name as the captain.

Use the keys ASDW or arrow keys (up, left, down, right) to move the spaceship horizontally and vertically. Press the space bar to shoot at enemies.

Avoid colliding with enemies to survive as long as possible and score the highest points.
